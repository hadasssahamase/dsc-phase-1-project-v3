Project one
*Project Overview
 For this project, you will use data cleaning, imputation, analysis, and visualization to generate insights for a business stakeholder.
*Business Problem
 A company seeks to expand and venture into a new industry to diversify its portfolio.The industry per say would be in the aviation sector where they are interested in purchasing and operating airplanes in both the commercial and private enterprises .They lack domain expertise about the potential risks of aircrafts and sort guidance in relation to the analysis on the data set they provided.
The goal of this project is to analyse and determine which aircraft are lowest of risk for the company.
*The Data

In the `data` folder is a [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khsamaha/aviation-accident-database-synopses) from the National Transportation Safety Board that includes aviation accident data from 1962 to 2023 about civil aviation accidents and selected incidents in the United States and international waters.
*Description of data
The Data set provided(AviationData.csv) has 90,348rows and 31 columns before data cleaning process. It is noted that this data set contains may missing values.
*Data Preparation
During the data cleaning process three columns : latitude,longitude and event id were dropped due to their irrelevancy to the analysis.
All categorical data that had missing values were filled with a placeholder unknown and numerical data was filled in with its median values.
The columns schedule and aircarrier were dropped as they had more than 50% of their data missing values.
The data set had a final of  82248 rows and 24 columns which were used for data visualization and analysis.
*Conclusions
From the data set provided :
1.Most accidents were accidental with 97.2%
2.Most accidents occured during the landing phase .
3.The Vmc weather condition has the most impact on aircraft accidents.
4.The reciporacting engine type is prone to more accidents.
5.The 2 type engine has the most fatal injured people.




*Recommendations
1.The turbo fan engine is safest engine type with the highest number of uninjured people.
2.The make Hester lee model Rutan Vari Eze, Hiller model (Uh-12l3, Uh-12l4) and Hiller-rogerson helicopter model Uh12e are safest aircarfts to start with.
3.Most people in the united states use aircrafts for personal use .
4.Start an institutional or leasing aviational institution centres aircrafts as instructional is the second most use for aircrafts.
5.Vigourously train the pilots in landing and taking off of the aircrafts as that is where most accidents occur.
*Closing Remarks
I would like to thank the stakeholders and shareholders for this opportunity to give my analysed insights on aviation and hope it can be help to charter a path in the field of aviation.
